# This Dockerfile creates an image that contains the go-greeter executable.
# The image is based on a small Alpine Linux image.
# The image uses a non-root user with a known UID/GID to run the container.
# The image has a single entrypoint, the go-greeter executable.
FROM golang:1.19-alpine AS builder

# Set the working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the Go source file into the container
COPY . .

# Build the Go program inside the container
RUN go build -o go-greeter .

# Use a small Alpine Linux image as the base image for the final container
